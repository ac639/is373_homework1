# Collaborating on GitHub

Create a new repository (or go to second line if repo exists) by clicking the + on the right corner of GitHub

Set up the repository and then go to the "Settings" tab.

Click the "Collaborators" button that will appear on the left of the page.

Add a collaborator by adding their GitHub username. The person you are adding will receive
an e-mail to join the repository. When they do they will have full commit  access.

Once all collaborators are added, you can start developing on the repository.

It is recommended for the master branch to kept stable and to make separate branches for developing.

Each collaborator will make his/her own branch on Phpstorm and then commit and push to Github.
